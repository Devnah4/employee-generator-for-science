## Inspiration

<p>"Science isn't about why, it's about why not. Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not marry safe science if you love it so much? In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you in the butt on the way out, because you are fired! Not you, test subject, you're doing fine. Yes, you! Box. your stuff, out the front door, parking lot, car, goodbye!"</p>
